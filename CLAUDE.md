## LANGUAGE RULE — MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTIONS

ALL code, comments, variable/function names, commit messages, PR descriptions, and any
other written content in this repository MUST be in English. This applies regardless of
the language the user writes to Claude Code in. Never write Spanish (or any other
language) into files, commits, or code in this repo.

## Repo purpose

`landing` is the internal Cloudflare Worker behind the **franciscosolis.cl** landing
page. It is not exposed to the public internet directly: the root gateway Worker
(`api.franciscosolis.cl`, repo `api.franciscosolis.cl`, submodule `apps/api`) reaches it
through a Cloudflare **service binding** and proxies `/landing/*` to it. This repo is
also pulled into that monorepo as a git submodule at `apps/landing`, but it's a
standalone git repo with its own history and remote.

Its main job today is fetching live GitHub stats (commits, stars, profile) for the
`Im-Fran` account via the GitHub REST/GraphQL APIs and exposing them as JSON.

## Stack

- Cloudflare Workers, Hono, hono-openapi, valibot, axios, Wrangler, TypeScript.
- Dependency versions come from the parent workspace's pnpm `catalog` (see the parent
  monorepo's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) — use `catalog:` in `package.json`, don't hardcode.
- `pnpm` install/deps are managed from the **monorepo root**, not from inside this dir.

## Commands (run from this directory, `apps/landing/`)

- `pnpm run dev` → `wrangler dev --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8788 --inspector-port 9230`
- `pnpm run deploy` → `wrangler deploy --minify`
- `pnpm run cf-typegen` → `wrangler types --env-interface CloudflareBindings` — run after
  editing `wrangler.jsonc` so `Hono<{ Bindings: Env }>` (`src/env.ts`) stays in sync.

No separate `build` script — Wrangler bundles as part of `dev`/`deploy`.

## Environment

- `.dev.vars` (gitignored, copy from `.dev.vars.example`) holds `GH_TOKEN`, the GitHub
  token used to call the REST/GraphQL APIs for the `Im-Fran` account's stats. Never
  commit real tokens.

## Source layout

- `src/index.ts` — Hono app: CORS/charset middleware, `onError`, health check (`GET /`).
- `src/stats/index.ts` — mounts the stats sub-routes.
- `src/stats/github/` — one file per GitHub stats concern: `commits.ts`, `profile.ts`,
  `stars.ts`, `pull-requests.ts`, `headers.ts` (shared auth headers), `index.ts` (route
  list at `/stats/github`).
- `src/env.ts` — `Env` type declaring bindings/secrets (`GH_TOKEN`).

## Architecture notes (non-obvious)

- **Every route is described with `describeRoute` + a valibot schema**, and the OpenAPI
  document at `/openapi.json` is generated from those schemas via `hono-openapi` — there
  is no hand-written spec. When adding/changing a route, update the schema, not a
  separate spec file, or the two will drift.
- **This spec gets consumed remotely**: the root `api` Worker fetches this Worker's
  `/openapi.json` over the `LANDING` service binding and merges it under the `/landing/*`
  prefix in its own combined spec (`mergeRemoteSpecs` in `apps/api/src/openapi.ts`).
  Breaking changes to route shapes here ripple into that merged doc.
- **Star counting paginates GraphQL**: `getGitHubStars` walks every repo the user owns
  via the GitHub GraphQL API and sums `stargazers.totalCount` — it's not a single REST
  call, keep pagination handling if you touch this.
- **JSON charset middleware**: a shared middleware appends `; charset=UTF-8` to
  `application/json` responses because Hono's `c.json()` doesn't set one by default —
  don't remove it, it prevents non-ASCII responses being mangled by Latin-1-defaulting
  clients.
- **Error shape**: `onError` normalizes both `HTTPException` and unexpected errors into
  `{ code, error }` with the matching HTTP status — keep new error paths consistent.
- **No public route in production**: this Worker only needs to be deployed under the
  exact name `landing` (see `wrangler.jsonc`, `name: "landing"`) for the parent `api`
  Worker's `LANDING` service binding to resolve; it doesn't need a custom domain.
